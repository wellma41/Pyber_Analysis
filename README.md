# Pyber_Analysis

##Overview
We ended this project with two products.
	
	 A Data Frame that summarized a break down of the following metrics by urban, suburban, and rural cities.
	-Total Rides
	-Total Drivers
	-Total Fare
	-Average Fare per Ride
	-Average Fare per Driver

	
	A line chart detailing the total weekly fares by urban, suburban, and rural cities.
	

##Results

	Three major determinations can be made with this data
	-First, unsurprisingly we can see that the urban environments have the highest volume of rides (summary fig) consistantly over the entire year. (chart)
	-Second, the less densely populated a city the higher the fare per ride and per driver, with the per driver rate having a greater increase with less density.
	-Third, only in urban areas are there more drivers than total rides (ratio 0.67 rides per driver). Suburban and Rural have a rides per driver ratio of 1.27 and 1.60 respectively.

##Summary

	###Suggestions for the amelioration of the dispartiy in ride costs.The availability of drivers seems to have a relationship to the fare.

	-Provide incentives for ubran driver so service suburban and rural areas to increase the supply.
	-Provide incentives in suburban and rural areas to promote an increase in the amount of drivers from the local populace.
	-Launch an add campaign in suburban and rural areas to increase demand to hopefully increase the amount of drivers and lower the cost of a ride.
